<h3>Trains</h3>
<p>We are investigating the option of adding a train station to the bus route. It would mean potentially catching a train to Wyong station from where we would collect you. However, the train times arenâ€™t very convenient (so it could potentially mean a little waiting around and leaving the wedding a little early).
If you are considering this option, we ask for you to talk to us ASAP (as we will need to work with you to come up with a solution).</p>
