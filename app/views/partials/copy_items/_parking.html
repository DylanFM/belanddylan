<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>Please turn left before the hall and park near the Rural Fire Service Brigade building. It’s to the left of the tennis courts. The gravelled carpark outside the hall will be occupied by our caterer. If you need to you can quickly drop off your occupants out the very front of the hall, but please don’t park there. 
There is a stretch of grass to the left of the hall (just in front of the tennis court, next to the road). The hall people have asked kindly to make sure no one parks there. The sceptic system is beneath and I think there may have been some gnarly situations in the past.</p>
