<h3>Driving</h3>
<p>The map above shows a rough guide for driving. Once you take the exit off the M1 you are looking at about a 30–minute drive to the hall. 
Keep in mind that the hall is quite a way along Jilliby Road, so once you turn at the cemetery, settle yourself in for a bit more of a drive along that road. You’ll see the hall on the lefthand side alongside some tennis courts.</p>
