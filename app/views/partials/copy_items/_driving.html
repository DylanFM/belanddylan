<h3>Driving</h3>
<p>We have mapped out a rough guide for driving on the map. Once you take the exit off the M1 you are looking at about a 30 minute drive to the hall. 
Keep in mind that it is quite a way along Jilliby Road, so once you turn at the cemetery settle yourself in for a bit more of a drive on that road. Youâ€™ll see the hall on the lefthand side alongside some tennis courts.</p>
