<h3>Basic info</h3>
<p>Dooralong Hall is in a fairly remote rural location. You are not going to find any 7–11s, Maccas, street lights or lines on the road. In fact, once you make the turn at the cemetery you are looking at 10k’s of winding country road (which is sealed, so fear not for your car). Think cows, fields, lots of trees and the occasional smudge of human existence in the form of a house or two.</p>
